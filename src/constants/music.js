			'I have no musical degree but I like to play a little bit of everything. When I started, the tendency was always to learn classical compositions like Cavatina, Romance d\'Amour or Asturias that I consider essential in my guitar repertoire. Unfortunately I did not give the proper attention to one of my favourite classical compositions, Canon, until several versions began to appear on Youtube. I decided to make my adaptation largely based on Trace Bundy\'s version. A work in progress.'
